## Autonimize AI assessment : CpG Detector

This repository contain my approach, solution and releventd details as asked.

## Synopsis
CpG Detector is a web application built to predict the number of CpG (consecutive "CG" patterns) in a given DNA sequence. The project leverages a neural network model using a bidirectional LSTM architecture to handle variable-length DNA sequences and outputs the predicted CpG count. Additionally, a regex-based CpG count is provided for reference. 

This project can be accessed via a web interface built using Streamlit, where users can input DNA sequences and get results from both the neural network and regex-based methods.

## Approach
The CpG Detector project was designed to handle DNA sequences of variable lengths using a bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The key steps of the approach are:

1. **Data Generation**: 
   - DNA sequences were generated randomly with lengths between a defined range (e.g., 64 to 128).
   - Labels were generated by counting the actual number of CpG pairs in the sequence using a regex-based function.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - A bidirectional LSTM was used to process variable-length DNA sequences.
   - Input sequences were one-hot encoded to represent the 5 possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T, and padding).
   - The model consisted of an LSTM layer, followed by a LayerNorm and fully connected layers to predict the CpG count.

3. **Training**:
   - The model was trained using MSE (Mean Squared Error) as the loss function.
   - A learning rate scheduler was used to reduce the learning rate based on validation loss.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The trained model was used to predict the CpG count for new DNA sequences, and the results were displayed alongside a regex-based count for comparison.

## Results
The CpG Detector successfully predicts CpG counts with a reasonable accuracy, achieving low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) during the validation process. Below are some key metrics obtained from the evaluation:
